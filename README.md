# IPAL: Decentralized Knowledge Market
## White Paper v1.1

## Abstract

[Ipal network](https://ipal.network) introduces a revolutionary decentralized marketplace for knowledge exchange using blockchain technology. This white paper outlines the technical architecture and tokenomics of the IPAL platform, focusing on the fully implemented NFT-gated access system and the upcoming $IPAL token ecosystem. The platform enables content creators to monetize their knowledge while providing consumers with verifiable, immutable access rights through a transparent and secure mechanism.

## Introduction

In the current digital economy, knowledge creation and sharing face multiple challenges: centralized platforms extracting excessive fees, lack of ownership verification, and payment inefficiencies. IPAL addresses these challenges by creating a decentralized marketplace where creators maintain control over their knowledge assets while consumers gain transparent, verifiable access rights.

The IPAL ecosystem consists of two main components:
- **KnowledgeMarket Contract**: A fully implemented smart contract that manages access NFTs for knowledge vaults
- **$IPAL Token**: An upcoming governance and utility token (currently in development)

---

## Technical Architecture

IPAL's architecture is built on Ethereum smart contracts that extend the ERC721 standard to support time-limited access controls. This design enables secure, transparent, and efficient knowledge exchange without intermediaries.

## NFT-Gated Access System

The core of IPAL's functionality is the NFT-gated access system, enabling knowledge creators to sell access to their content through time-limited NFTs. When a consumer purchases access, they receive an NFT representing their access rights to specific knowledge vaults. The payment is automatically split by the smart contract: the vault owner receives the main share, a co-owner (if defined) receives a portion, and a small platform fee is collected. This ensures transparent and automated revenue distribution without intermediaries.

### Vault Owner Revenue Flow

    subgraph "Knowledge Market Contract"
        KnowledgeMarket.sol -->|Mint Subscription| MintFunction
        MintFunction -->|Updates| DealInfo
    end

    subgraph DealInfo
        DealInfo -->|Contains| VaultID
        DealInfo -->|Contains| ImageURL
        DealInfo -->|Contains| Price
    end
```

### DealInfo: On-Chain Access Records

The `DealInfo` data structure plays a critical role in IPAL's ecosystem. It stores key transaction details on the blockchain, including:

- **VaultID**: Unique identifier for the knowledge vault
- **ImageURL**: Visual representation of the vault content
- **Price**: Cost paid for access

By storing these details on-chain, IPAL ensures complete transparency and immutability of access transactions. This approach:

1. **Enhances Asset Liquidity**: Investors and users can easily verify the value and authenticity of access rights
2. **Guarantees Immutability**: Once recorded, access details cannot be altered
3. **Creates Trustless Verification**: Any party can independently verify access rights
4. **Protects Creators**: Provides permanent record of ownership and access grants

---

## Smart Contract Implementation

The KnowledgeMarket contract implements several key features:

**Update July 2025**  
The `KnowledgeMarket` contract has been enhanced to support:  
- **Co-ownership** of subscriptions, allowing one address to share management of a vault  
- **Platform fee splitting**, enabling automatic distribution of revenue between primary and co-owners  
- **Improved metadata handling**, with richer on-chain data for vaults and subscription NFTs  

### Subscription Management
Vault owners can:
- Register a vault on-chain, establishing ownership and metadata.
- Create subscription offerings (pricing, duration, co-owner share) linked to their registered vault.
- Offer free (zero-price) access when appropriate.
- Update or remove subscription offerings at any time.
- Customize the visual representation of their content.

### Access Control
The contract provides:
- Time-limited access to vaults based on NFT ownership
- Verification methods to check access rights
- Access expiration based on predefined durations

### NFT Representation
Each access NFT includes:
- On-chain metadata about the knowledge vault
- Visual representation of the content
- Expiration information
- Ownership verification

### Security Features
The contract implements multiple security measures:
- Reentrancy protection for all state-changing functions
- Input validation for all parameters
- Zero-address checking
- Custom error handling
- Event emission for important state changes

### Proxy Pattern Implementation
The IPAL platform utilizes a transparent upgradeable proxy pattern that:
- Provides a consistent interface for users
- Enables interaction with the KnowledgeMarket contract
- Maintains a standardized access point
- Supports future upgradability while preserving the same contract address
- Allows the team to fix potential bugs or add features without disruption to users

#### Transparent Proxy Architecture
The proxy architecture consists of three main components:
1. **KnowledgeMarket (Implementation)**: Contains the core business logic
2. **TransparentUpgradeableProxy**: Forwards calls to the implementation while keeping its address constant
3. **ProxyAdmin**: Manages proxy administration, including upgrades to new implementations

This architecture follows the EIP-1967 standard for proxy storage slots, ensuring compatibility with block explorers and wallet providers.

```mermaid

title: "Transparent Proxy Architecture"

graph TD
    User[User] -->|Interacts with| Proxy
    Proxy[TransparentUpgradeableProxy] -->|Delegates calls| Implementation[KnowledgeMarket Implementation]
    Admin[ProxyAdmin] -->|Manages| Proxy
    Admin -->|Can upgrade| Implementation
    
    subgraph "Storage Layer"
        Proxy -->|Reads/Writes| Storage[On-chain Storage]
    end
```

Benefits of this architecture:
- **Immutable User-Facing Address**: The proxy address remains constant, simplifying integrations
- **Seamless Upgrades**: Implementation can be upgraded without affecting user experience
- **Separation of Concerns**: Admin functions are isolated in a separate contract for security
- **Future-Proofing**: Allows for bug fixes and feature additions without redeployment

## $IPAL Token (Draft)

> Note: This section represents planned functionality that is currently under development.

The $IPAL token will serve as both a governance and utility token within the IPAL ecosystem. Token holders will be able to participate in platform governance, receive rewards, and access premium features.

### Tokenomics

```mermaid

flowchart TD
    llc("Wyoming LLC") --"represent"--> otoco
    otoco(Otoco DAO contract) --"is owner"--> treasury.sol
    otoco --"mint"--> $IPAL.sol
    $IPAL.sol --"for"--> vesting.sol
    otoco --"is owner"--> vesting.sol
    vesting.sol --"transfer to"--> treasury.sol
    vesting.sol --"transfer to"--> stakeholders(stake holders)
```

### Token Distribution

```mermaid
pie showData
    title Stakeholders Distribution
    "Project treasury" : 70
    "Share holders" : 25
    "Users (airdrop)" : 5
```

The planned token distribution ensures a balanced ecosystem that rewards early contributors while maintaining sufficient project treasury for ongoing development and marketing efforts.
